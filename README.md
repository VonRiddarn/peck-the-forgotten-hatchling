## Broken conventions and the reasoning

### Using public fields instead of properties

Due to this project being developed for WebGL nearly all decisions will be made around performance.  
Properties adds a redundant dive in the call stack - therefore fields will be used directly.  
To differentiate true public fields from fields that should be treated as properties, we use PascalCase for non true public fields.

`Health` public field posing as a property.  
`health` true public field.
